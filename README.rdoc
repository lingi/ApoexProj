This is a client for searching allabolag.se (Ruby 2.0.0p247)

Before running a database (db_AllaBolag) in mysql has to be created by e.g.
create database db_AllaBolag;
user: user1 pw: <none>
this can be changed in the database.yml file

Then to set up the database type "rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=development"
This will create the necessary tables, dependencies etc.

Run the project to start the server:
rails server -b 0.0.0.0 -p 3000 -e development

To search either run this file from the console by: "ruby client.rb companyname"
or connect to "localhost:3000/companies" in browser
